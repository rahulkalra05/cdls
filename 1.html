 <h2>Next Generation Learning Environments</h2>
 <h3>Gartner Mention</h3>
 <p>comproDLS™ and Compro Technologies have been mentioned in Gartner Research since 2015 in context of emerging education technologies. In 2016 there were three mentions:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><h4>Exostructural Strategy</h4></li>
 <p>Exostructure refers to the capability to leverage modern interoperability standards to get best results from emerging cloud based services, tools, and partnerships . The goal is to build an integrated “exoskeleton” of these services that supports an organization's goals from the outside, rather than continuing to add new services on the inside. See Gartner Hype Cycle for Education (2016)</p>
 <li><h4>Learning stack providers/h4></li>
 <p>A learning stack is a SAAS based learning environment designed from the ground-up to be flexible, extensible, interoperable, and dynamic. The core layer supports interoperability functions for rest of the stack (like eBooks, coursewares, assessments, analytics etc.) with centralized services for storage & delivery of content. See Gartner Hype Cycle for Education (2016)</p>
 <li><h4>Algorithmic Learning providers/h4></li>
 <p>Algorithmic learning approach prescribes a combined application of Learning Analytics, Digital Assessments and Adaptive Learning, to develop personalized learning solutions. While Learning Analytics are used to collect learning engagement data, Digital Assessments enable quick feedback loops driving algorithms for Adaptive Learning. See Analytics, Assessment and Adaptive Learning will Prepare You for the Algorithmic Education Evolution (2016)</p>
 <h2>EDUCAUSE : NGDLE Initiative</h2>
 <p>comproDLS™ is consistent and aligned with the principles and objectives articulated in the NGDLE Research Paper (April 2014), published by the Next Generation Digital Learning Environment Initiative (NGDLE) of EDUCAUSE.</p>
 <li><p>" …..Interoperability is the linchpin of the NGDLE. The ability to integrate tools and exchange content and learning data enables everything else. ... All components must be able to accept and exchange curricular content in common formats. This would ensure that content can be exchanged, transferred, and utilized.... Integration must be easy enough for end sers to quickly and easily add tools to the environment, without help from central IT... The learning environment will continue to be the key source of learning data. The unimpeded exchange of data is imperative to be able to aggregate, integrate, and analyze learning data....... The NGDLE must enable the creation of new interoperability standards in ways that are compatible with its other standards so that overall coherence is maintained…. " See NGDLE Research Paper</p></li>
